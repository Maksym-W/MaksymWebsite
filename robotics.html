    <h1>I am the President of the Robotics Club at UTM, and I want YOU!</h1>
    <hr>

    As of me writing this (June 2023), the academic year hasn't started yet at UTM, and by extension, UTM Robotics Club activities
    For now I am preparing workshops for Robotics. Once a month, the club will talk about one topic and teach you how to do something
    As well, we are preparing some project for you to use these workshop skills on. Still am working out the details on this. <br>
    If you want to get involved, fill out this form. A bigger club means I get to bug the student union for more money, which means better events.
