    I happen to have a list of projects that I eventually want to get to, some of those being youtube videos. Below are the list of youtube videos I want to do

    


    <h1>Repunzel YTP</h1>
    I always liked YTP videos and I think they can be considered an art form. I have made a couple, and I have been working on one inconsistantly for the past year. 
    Im going to put it out before anything else on my todo list. Its also probably going to be my last YTP video. <Br>

    <h1> Mike Harris Sucks</h1>
    You might notice that for a Computer Science/Math Student, Im quite interested in politics and history. Its a bit of a byproduct of who I grew up around
    One of the people that had a formative impact on my outlook on politics was my high school politics teacher. 
    One of the things he mentioned was how Mike Harris was a "troglydyte" in his words. This video would be to investigate how true that statement is.<Br>

    The tragedy of Kim Jong Nam<Br>
    Peterson's Downfall<Br>
    The Persision of being unfocused<Br>
    Internation support of hilter before WW2 (inspired by christie pits)<Br>

    <h1>Collatz Theorem (And why higher level math is pain)</h1>
    When I was a kid, I thought that there would be an end with mathematics, as all the rules should eventually end. 
    Obviously as time went on, I realized this was a silly notion as there were always more math to learn.
    In University, I truly understood how stuck mathematics is as my profs would introduce theorems that haven't been solved
    One such theorem is the Collatz Theorem, and no one has solve it yet.
    This video would be a dive into analyzing this theorem, why it hasn't been solves, and other bits of trivia<Br>

    <h1>Boardgame AIs</h1>
    In univeristy, one of my profs introduced me to a game called Quarto, by all accounts a really fun board game you should try out.
    He told me that in his undergrad, he built an AI that can beat people in Quarto. This inspired me to try and build my own AI that beats people.
    I figured Connect 4 would be good because it seems simple enough and I need to beat my friend who keeps winning. Its really tricky, because how should you go about it?
    Should you have the AI know all possible combinations? Or have it recognize patterns?<Br>
