    I happen to have a list of projects that I eventually want to get to, some of those being youtube videos. Below are the list of youtube videos I want to do

    


    <h1>Repunzel YTP</h1>
    I always liked YTP videos and I think they can be considered an art form. I have made a couple, and I have been working on one inconsistantly for the past year. 
    Im going to put it out before anything else on my todo list. Its also probably going to be my last YTP video.
    Making YTPs as a teenager was fun, but I think I have outgrown it. There are other things I would want to make <Br>

    Idiots guide to physics<Br>
    I think physics is a facinating subject and if I could redo my university career,
    I would have done a physics minor. The best I have right now is just doing self study and 
    doing personal projects. I would like to one day make a video which is about doing the most dangerous 
    beginner level physics experients, starting with putting metal forks in places they don't belong.
    Obviously not safe, but would make for one hell of a video.

    <h1> Mike Harris Sucks</h1>
    You might notice that for a Computer Science/Math Student, Im quite interested in politics and history. Its a bit of a byproduct of who I grew up around
    One of the people that had a formative impact on my outlook on politics was my high school politics teacher. 
    One of the things he mentioned was how Mike Harris was a "troglydyte" in his words. This video would be to investigate how true that statement is.<Br>

    The tragedy of Kim Jong Nam<Br>
    One of the more facinating figures in history is kim jong uns half brother, kim jong nam. He was supposed to become supreme ruler of north korea, but he was 
    a bit too liberal for his father. What broke the camels back was kim jong nams visit to japanese disney land. You can imagine his father wasn't pleased, And
    disinherited him from the throne. Later, kim jong nam got assassinated by kim jong un. I would love to make a documentary about this guy one day.

    Peterson's Downfall<Br>
    Back when I was finishing up Elementary school, my friends and I were big Jordan Peterson fans (Some of us even said lets go to UofT because he teaches there.). Obviously, years later 
    we started to notice that he went insane to put it midly. None of my friends idolized him anymore, and we certainly didn't care about going to UofT because of him.
    I would want to make a documentary one day which examinzes how we stoped idolizing him, and how he got more insane over the years.

    Internation support of hilter before WW2 (inspired by christie pits)<Br>
    Did you know that Toronto had a nazi related riot in 1933? Yeah, its absolutely crazy to think that this kind of stuff existed back then! Id want to make a video examining this event, and just how different 
    countries around the world has differing levels of support of nazi germany. Obviously, the support in numbers was low in countries like canada, but its intriguing to investigate non-the-less.

    <h1>Collatz Theorem (And why higher level math is pain)</h1>
    When I was a kid, I thought that there would be an end with mathematics, as all the rules should eventually end. 
    Obviously as time went on, I realized this was a silly notion as there were always more math to learn.
    In University, I truly understood how stuck mathematics is as my profs would introduce theorems that haven't been solved
    One such theorem is the Collatz Theorem, and no one has solve it yet.
    This video would be a dive into analyzing this theorem, why it hasn't been solves, and other bits of trivia<Br>

    <h1>Boardgame AIs</h1>
    In univeristy, one of my profs introduced me to a game called Quarto, by all accounts a really fun board game you should try out.
    He told me that in his undergrad, he built an AI that can beat people in Quarto. This inspired me to try and build my own AI that beats people.
    I figured Connect 4 would be good because it seems simple enough and I need to beat my friend who keeps winning. Its really tricky, because how should you go about it?
    Should you have the AI know all possible combinations? Or have it recognize patterns?<Br>

    <h1>Video game creating!</h1>
    Ive always loved video games and even before I got into coding, i thought making a video game would be really cool. There some complicated things I would like to make a video game out of
    (WW2 civilian survivor game, a game about 2 guys trying to take down a mafia run town, and just some simple kung fu magic game). The most easy game to make would be a 1st person shooter which 
    changes your abilities depending on what your speed is. Il try submitting this idea to the GDDC at UofT and see if it goes anywhere.
