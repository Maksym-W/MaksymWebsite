    I happen to have a list of projects that I eventually want to get to, some of those being youtube videos. Below are the list of youtube videos I want to do

    


    <h1>Repunzel YTP</h1>
    I always liked YTP videos and I think they can be considered an art form. I have made a couple, and I have been working on one inconsistantly for the past year. 
    Im going to put it out before anything else on my todo list. Its also probably going to be my last YTP video. <Br>
